# Cholera-GIS-Analysis
Cholera reacting game - tasked with using statistical analysis to prove Cholera was spread by miasma (bad air).

I was given the character George Foxley, a committed member of the Board of Governors and Directors of the Poor of St. James Parish. Foxley is deeply conerned with the dire state of urban life in London. My goal is to advocate for policies and initiatives that prioritize sanitation improvements within the Parish. 

Foxley is an Anticontagionist - One who believes disease is not spread by human-to-human contact, but rather miasmas (bad air).

My goal is to put my biases aside, and prove with my statistical analysis skills that it is indeed the bad air that is spreading Cholera. I am given a number of sources to help prove my case. I am given a lot of data, specifically data that tells me how many people died in each household, as well as the surrounding conditions of the houses. 

The GM has provided me with some outside data to help with my analyis, including shapefiles to make geographical plots of the town. In coordination with the data I am given about deaths per household, and other factors, this is a gold mine. The aim of this project is to teach myself GIS, to help further my cause (whether it's wrong or not).
